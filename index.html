        A beautiful lady born a very cute baby and the atmosphere there is very lively . His parents together named that child NITTY. When the child turned 5 years old,he was sent to study in a private school .One night that little child starts crying remembering his parents because he is very small and lives in a hostel away from his parents .That night a miss there sang him a lullaby and put him to sleep. But the next day when his parents were told ,they became  very nervous and decided to bring him home.Because Nitty used to cry a lot in the hostel.Not only his friends but his parents loved him very much .Due to which he had to complete his 10th and 12th studies by staying in his village.Till 10th class,Nitty had no knowledge of his existence or not .Meaning he did not think about what he wanted to become when he grew up? what work needs to be done .Due to which he used to study only at that time .And he scored about 86.5 % marks in 10th ,which was a matter of great pride for him and his family. But when he went to 11th ,then he started thinking about what he wants to become and what he wants to do in his life.Due to which he started feeling very sad and disappointed.It is believed that he started thinking a lot about his future.Seeing this his mother getting very upset .But when his mother asked what happened to you son,he would smile and say that nothing happened to me .Just like that.

  <p>
    One day he was watching a movie .The characters of that movie got imprinted on his mind and he started  thinking that after all,these people are also human beings who are known by their name and by their work. What is there in that ? which is not in me,by which the whole world knows it.Gradually the thought started coming in his mind that he has to become a bigger person than he is . AT the same time he was also studying  .But as he started thinking why is he in this world ? ,So he thought that one day he too would become such that the whole world would know him by his name and his work. Due to which he used to think a lot about how to be made,how to do think a gradually he spent two years in her thoughts and dreams . And he was completely sure that he would become a great man .
    One day he wanted to tell the whole world that yes,every human being can do anything if he wants ,if he can imagine .He used to talk to his mother a lot about this that one day he has to become a great person .One day he had to tell her that her son can also become a great person .But his mother was such that she was afraid that my son might deviate from his path .Due to which she also became worried about what my son was doing.Don’t choose wrong path. But ,He even thought that he could do everything on his own,so when he went to12th ,he didn’t go anywhere for coaching or tuition .He himself started preparing at his home due to which in 12th he got some percentage less than his friends.
